    "# Small Tutorial Using Fracnetics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary 🔭\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the **Fracnetics** library to solve the CartPole environment problem from Gymnasium (fork from OpenAI Gym).\n",
    "\n",
    "Fractnetics is a Python library for **Genetic Network Programming (GNP)** enhanced with fractal geometry, which means it a subfield of Evolutionary Algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lunar Lander\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lunar Lander problem is a classic reinforcement learning task where an agent must safely land a spacecraft on a designated landing pad. The lander can control its main and side thrusters to adjust its position and velocity. The goal is to land softly and upright, while avoiding crashes or going out of bounds. Rewards are given for touching down gently and penalties for collisions, fuel use, or leaving the landing area. This problem tests an agent’s ability to balance precision control with strategic planning under continuous dynamics.\n",

    "## Evolutionary Aglortihms 🧬\n",
    "\n",
    "Evolutionary Algorithms are a family of optimization techniques inspired by the process of natural evolution. They work by maintaining a **population** of candidate solutions, which evolve over time through operations such as **selection, mutation, and crossover**. The idea is to iteratively improve solutions by mimicking survival of the fittest, where better solutions are more likely to be chosen and combined to form new ones. EAs are especially useful for solving complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional problems where traditional optimization methods may fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Genetic Network Programming 🦾\n",
    "\n",
    "Genetic Network Programming is a branch of evolutionary computation that represents solutions as **networks** of nodes rather than as linear strings (like in Genetic Algorithms). Each node corresponds to a function, decision, or action, and the network’s structure allows for recurrent flows of control. This enables GNP to model adaptive, flexible, and memory-dependent behaviors. It has been applied successfully in areas such as robotics, decision-making systems, and dynamic optimization tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next 🔥\n",
    "In this tutorial we will initialize a population, train it, validate it, and finally record a run.  \n",
