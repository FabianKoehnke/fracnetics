@article{HuiminZhao.2007,
	abstract = {Classification is a frequently encountered data mining problem. Decision tree techniques have been widely used to build classification models as such models closely resemble human reasoning and are easy to understand. Many real-world classification problems are cost-sensitive, meaning that different types of misclassification errors are not equally costly. Since different decision trees may excel under different cost settings, a set of non-dominated decision trees should be developed and presented to the decision maker for consideration, if the costs of different types of misclassification errors are not precisely determined. This paper proposes a multi-objective genetic programming approach to developing such alternative Pareto optimal decision trees. It also allows the decision maker to specify partial preferences on the conflicting objectives, such as false negative vs. false positive, sensitivity vs. specificity, and recall vs. precision, to further reduce the number of alternative solutions. A diabetes prediction problem and a credit card application approval problem are used to illustrate the application of the proposed approach.},

We present the most popular techniques for dealing with the complexities of the constrained portfolio optimization problem and experimentally analyse their strengths and weaknesses. In particular, we examine the efficient incorporation of complex real world constraints into the Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms and their corresponding effect on the efficient frontier formulation for the portfolio optimization problem. Moreover, we examine various constraint-handling approaches for the constrained portfolio optimization problem such as penalty functions and reparation operators and we draw conclusions about the efficacy of the examined approaches. We also examine the effect on the efficient frontier formulation by the application of different genetic operators and the relevant results are analysed. Finally, we address issues related with the various performance metrics that are applied for the evaluation of the derived solutions.},

@article{RezaRamezanian.2019,
	abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms are generally used to find or generate the best individuals in a population. Whenever these algorithms are applied to agent systems, they will lead to optimal solutions. Genetic Network Programming (GNP), which contains graph networks, is one of the developed evolutionary algorithms. When the aim is to forecast the share price or return, ascending and descending trends, volatilities, recent returns, fundamental and technical factors have remarkable impacts on the prediction. This is why technical indicators are used to constitute a set of trading rules. In this paper, we apply an integrated framework consisting of GNP model along with a reinforcement learning and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network to classify data and also time series models to forecast the stock return. Moreover, we utilize rules of accumulation based on the GNP model's results to forecast the return. The aim of using these models alongside one another is to estimate one-day return. The results derived from 9 stocks with regard to the Tehran Stock Exchange Market. GNP extracts a prodigious number of rules on the basis of 5 technical indicators with 3 times period. Next, MLP network classifies data and finds the similarity between future data and past data concerning a stock (5 sub-period) through classification. Subsequently, a number of conditions are established, in order to choose the best estimation between GNP-RL and ARMA. Distinct comparison with the ARMA--GARCH model, which is operated for return estimation and risk measurement in many researches, demonstrates an extended forecasting power of the proposed model, by the name of GNP--ARMA, reducing error by a mean of 16{\%}.},

The proposed method, combining the advantages of evolutionary algorithms and statistical model, has provided useful tools to construct portfolios and generate effective stock trading strategies for investors with different risk-attitudes. Simulation results on five stock indices show that model based on GNP and maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio performs the best in bull market, and that based on GNP and the global minimum risk portfolio performs the best in bear market. The portfolios constructed by Markowitz's mean--variance model performs the same as mean-CVaR model. It is clarified that the proposed system significantly improves the function and efficiency of original GNP, which can help investors make profitable decisions.},

	abstract = {The survey of the relevant literatures shows that there have been many studies for portfolio optimization problems and that the number of studies which have investigated the optimum portfolio using evolutionary computation is quite large. But, almost none of these studies deals with genetic relation algorithm (GRA), where GRA is one of the evolutionary methods with graph structure. This study presents an approach to large-scale portfolio optimization problems using GRA with a new operator, called guided mutation. In order to pick up the most efficient portfolio, GRA considers the correlation coefficient between stock brands as strength, which indicates the relation between nodes in each individual of GRA. Guided mutation generates offspring according to the average value of correlation coefficients in each individual, which means to enhance the exploitation ability of evolution of GRA. A genetic relation algorithm with guided mutation (GRA/G) for the portfolio optimization is proposed in this paper. Genetic network programming (GNP), which was proposed in our previous research, is used to validate the performance of the portfolio generated with GRA/G. The results show that GRA/G approach is successful in portfolio optimization.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a decision-making model of dynamic portfolio optimization for adapting to the change of stock prices based on an evolutionary computation method named genetic network programming (GNP). The proposed model, making use of the information from technical indices and candlestick chart, is trained to generate portfolio investment advice. Experimental results on the Japanese stock market show that the decision-making model using time adapting genetic network programming (TA-GNP) method outperforms other traditional models in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. A comprehensive analysis of the results is provided, and it is clarified that the TA-GNP method is effective on the portfolio optimization problem.},
