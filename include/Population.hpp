/**
 * @class Population 
 * @brief Manages the evolutionary population of GNP individuals (networks).
 *
 * @details
 * The Population class implements the evolutionary framework for Genetic Network Programming (GNP).
 * It provides all necessary operations for evolutionary optimization:
 * 
 * - **Population Management**: Initialization and maintenance of multiple network individuals
 * - **Fitness Evaluation**: Applying various fitness functions (accuracy, CartPole, Gymnasium environments)
 * - **Selection**: Tournament selection with elitism (to preserve best individuals)
 * - **Genetic Operators**: 
 *   - Edge mutation (topology changes)
 *   - Boundary mutation (parameter tuning)
 *   - Crossover (recombination of network structures)
 *   - Node addition/deletion (structural evolution)
 * 
 * The population evolves over generations through iterative applying fitness measurments,
 * selection, and mutation operators, which gradually improves the collective fitness and
 * discovering effective network structures for the target problem. A small tutorial can be found here:

         * This is a template method that provides a flexible interface for applying various
         * boundary mutation strategies to the population. For each non-elite individual:
         * 
         * 1. Iterates through all judgment nodes (type "J")
         * 2. Applies the provided mutation function to each judgment node
         * 
         * The mutation function receives:
         * - Reference to the node (for modifying boundaries)
         * - additionalMutationParam struct (containing network size or other context)
         * 
         * This template design allows implementing different boundary mutation strategies
         * (uniform, normal, fractal, adaptive) without code duplication.
         * 
         * **Elite protection**: Elite individuals are excluded from mutation.
