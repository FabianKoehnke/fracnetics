        "# Small Tutorial Using Fracnetics\n",
        "\n",
        "## Summary ðŸ”­\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates how to use the **Fracnetics** library to solve the CartPole environment problem from Gymnasium (fork from OpenAI Gym).\n",
        "\n",
        "Fractnetics is a Python library for **Genetic Network Programming (GNP)** enhanced with fractal geometry, which means it a subfield of Evolutionary Algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Cart Pole\n",
        "\n",
        "A pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.\n",

        "## Evolutionary Aglortihms ðŸ§¬\n",
        "\n",
        "Evolutionary Algorithms are a family of optimization techniques inspired by the process of natural evolution. They work by maintaining a **population** of candidate solutions, which evolve over time through operations such as **selection, mutation, and crossover**. The idea is to iteratively improve solutions by mimicking survival of the fittest, where better solutions are more likely to be chosen and combined to form new ones. EAs are especially useful for solving complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional problems where traditional optimization methods may fail.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Genetic Network Programming ðŸ¦¾\n",
        "\n",
        "Genetic Network Programming is a branch of evolutionary computation that represents solutions as **networks** of nodes rather than as linear strings (like in Genetic Algorithms). Each node corresponds to a function, decision, or action, and the networkâ€™s structure allows for recurrent flows of control. This enables GNP to model adaptive, flexible, and memory-dependent behaviors. It has been applied successfully in areas such as robotics, decision-making systems, and dynamic optimization tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Next ðŸ”¥\n",
        "In this tutorial we will initialize a population, train it, validate it, and finally record a run.  \n",
